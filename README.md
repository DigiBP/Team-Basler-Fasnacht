## Patient Appointment Scheduling Process - Digitalisation of Business Process - FHNW

Our group has decided to model and enhance a Bachelor Thesis of one team member. The thesis focuses on appointment scheduling tools especially in heathcare. At current state, most of hospitals and medical clinics are using phone as a medium to schedule, re-schedule or cancel appointments. This is perceived as an expense that can be eliminated through digitalization.

Our project considers two two scenarios:

- create an appointment
- prepare for the first consultation

According to our researches, in most _____ any statistics about medium? How many over phone? What age group?


### <ins>As-Is Process</ins>

The process starts with a phone call from the patient to the secretary of the respective hospital. First, the secretary records all the needed personal data from the patient. After this is done, the secretary checks the availability of the doctors within their calendars and suggest an appointment date. If the first appointment suggestion is fine for the patient the next step will be executed. If not, the appointment finding goes back and forth until both sides are satisfied. The secretary sets the appointment into the calendar of the respective doctor and sends a confirmation per post to the patient.
